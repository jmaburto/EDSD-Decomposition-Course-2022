# European Doctoral School of Demography 2022: Course on decomposition techniques

Start: 23/05/2022
End: 26/05/2022

Classes will start at 10.00am (Barcelona time)

Instructor: José Manuel Aburto
Co-Instructor: Serena Vigezzi

## Course description

The course will present essential methods for demographic analysis with a focus on decomposition techniques. The students will improve their skills in applying these methods in R. 

## Schedule (updated daily)
### Day 1
Origins of Decomposition

Decomposition 1 (Direct vs. compositional)

Kitagawa (1955)

Vaupel and Canudas Romo (2003)

### Day 2
Quick review

Prevalence based lifetables

Decomposition of life expectancy

### Day 3
Quick review

Cause-deleted lifetables

Lifespan variation

Linear integral decomposition

Stepwise decomposition method

### Day 4
Quick review

Competing risks review

Spread-Allocation-Timing decomposition

Formal Demography

### Challenge 1
With data on fertility (e.g. HFD) select 3 countries and analyze the change in their crude fertility rate (CFR) in a recent period (10 years) and decompose these changes following Kitagawa's decomposition and describe your results. Then for the most recent period select the two countries (among the 3) with the highest and lowest CFR and decompose their difference and describe your results.

### Challenge 2
Challenge 2: Use prevalence lifetables (you can use data from EurOHex) and the Sullivan method to calculate healthy life expectancy for females and males in a country of your choosing. What does this tell us about morbidity and mortality for females and males? Then decompose the life expectancy sex gap by age using the Arriaga method. Which ages are driving the gap?

### Challenge 3
Use the linear integral model to decompose the change in the standard deviation of the age-at-death distribution and life expectancy by age and cause of death for 3 countries you might be interested in (over time or between them). Interpret the results of life expectancy alongside standard deviation. Make it interesting.
You can use data from HCoD, HMD, WHO, GBD.

Students should be familiar with basic life table construction. Ideally, students should also have a basic understanding of decomposition methods. It is recommended that students read Preston et al. (2001) Chapters 2-4 prior to the commencement of the course (or an equivalent textbook covering life tables and decomposition). A basic command of R, including data handling, for-loops, and writing basic functions, is a prerequisite.
